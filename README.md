## üìö ShapesInc AI Chatbot for Discord ‚Äî User Manual

### 1. What This Bot Does

- **Image Understanding:** Send pictures, and the bot will describe or respond to them.
- **Natural Conversations:** Chat as if you‚Äôre talking to a real person.
- **On-Demand Code Generation:** Request code snippets tailored to your prompts.
- **User Recognition:** Maintains separate contexts for each Discord user, so it never confuses one user for another.

### 4. How to Use `/authorize`

* In any channel where your bot is present, type:

```ruby
/authorize
```

* The bot will reply with a private link (only visible to you).  
![Authorize Link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c7ee059-1c26-4a99-89d2-a91cf3bfad63)

* Click the link and copy the **authorization code** displayed.  
![Shapes Authorized Code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47e92ea5-a31c-42b4-b4a2-85bb995748b7)

4. Return to Discord and run:

```ruby
/authorize code:YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

- Replace `YOUR_CODE_HERE` with the code you copied.
   
* If successful, you‚Äôll see:

```text
Successfully Authorised!
```

Now you can chat with the bot or send images.

### 5. Common Troubleshooting

- **Bot Won‚Äôt Start or Crashes on Launch**

- Verify your `.env` (or Render environment variables) have no extra spaces and correct quotation marks.
   
- Ensure you ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

- Check your Discord token‚Äîif it was regenerated or revoked, update it in your environment.
   
- **Bot Is Online but Doesn‚Äôt Respond**

- Confirm the bot has been invited with the right permissions (e.g., ‚ÄúSend Messages,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead Message History,‚Äù ‚ÄúUse Slash Commands‚Äù).
   
- Make sure slash commands are registered. Sometimes you need to restart the bot or wait a few minutes for Discord to sync.

- **‚ÄúInvalid Authorization Code‚Äù When Using `/authorize`**

- Copy the code exactly‚Äîno extra spaces or line breaks.
   
- Ensure you clicked the link from the same Discord account that ran `/authorize`.
