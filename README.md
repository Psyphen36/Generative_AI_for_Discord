1. In your terminal (still inside the repo folder), create a file named .env (if it doesn‚Äôt exist).
   
   Open .env in a text editor, and paste in:

   ```ini
   SHAPES_API_KEY="your_shapesinc_api_key_here"
   SHAPES_APP_ID="your_shapesinc_app_id_here"
   DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token_here"
   MODEL="your_shapesinc_model_name_here"
   ```

   Replace each placeholder in quotes with your actual values.
   
    **SHAPES_API_KEY**: Paste the API Key from ShapesInc.

    **SHAPES_APP_ID**: Paste the App ID from ShapesInc.

    **DISCORD_TOKEN**: You‚Äôll get this in the next section.

    **MODEL**: This should match your bot‚Äôs ‚Äúmodel name‚Äù on ShapesInc (e.g. if you named your bot ‚Äúotahun,‚Äù then MODEL="otahun").

2. Save that and run:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. You should see messages like ‚ÄúBot is starting‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnected to Discord.‚Äù

   /authorize
   ```

6. Back in Discord, type (replace `KJXM9ZUM` with the one you got):

   ```ini
   /authorize code:KJXM9ZUM
   ```
   
7. If successful, the bot will say ‚ÄúSuccessfully Autholrised!‚Äù and you can start chatting or sending images.

### 5. Common Troubleshooting

* **Bot doesn‚Äôt start / crash on launch:**

  * Double-check that your `.env` (or Render environment variables) are correct‚Äîno extra spaces or missing quotes.
  * Ensure you ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
  * Check the Discord token: if it‚Äôs revoked, regenerate it in the Developer Portal.
* **Bot is online but doesn‚Äôt respond to commands:**

  * Make sure your bot is invited to the server with the correct permissions (e.g. ‚ÄúSend Messages,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead Message History,‚Äù ‚ÄúUse Slash Commands‚Äù).
  * Check that you registered the slash commands (sometimes you need to run a separate script or wait a few minutes for Discord to update).
* **‚ÄúInvalid authorization code‚Äù when using `/authorize`:**

  * Copy the code exactly (no extra spaces).
  * Make sure you clicked the link from the same Discord user‚Äîonly that user sees the code.
