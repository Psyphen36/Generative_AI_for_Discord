* **Chats like a real human:** Text conversations feel natural.
* **Writes code on request:** Ask it to generate code snippets.(vary depending upon what prompts you gave to your own bot)
* **Recognizes each Discord user:** It won‚Äôt confuse everyone for ‚Äúyou.‚Äù

   *(Insert a screenshot of the terminal running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.)*

#### 3.6. Run Locally (Optional)

> **Note:** Running on your local computer is fine for testing, but it will stop working if you close your machine or lose internet.

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

#### 3.7. Host on Render (Recommended for 24/7 Uptime)

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and **sign up** (you can use GitHub to log in).

2. Click **New** ‚Üí **Web Service** ‚Üí **Connect to GitHub** ‚Üí select your `ShapesInc_For_Discord` repo.

3. Under **Environment**, add these variables exactly as in your `.env` file:

   | Key              | Value                          |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
   | SHAPES\_API\_KEY | (your\_shapesinc\_api\_key)    |
   | SHAPES\_APP\_ID  | (your\_shapesinc\_app\_id)     |
   | DISCORD\_TOKEN   | (your\_discord\_bot\_token)    |

6. Click **Create Web Service**. Render will read your repo, install dependencies, and run your bot automatically.

7. Whenever you push code to GitHub, Render will re-deploy it for you.

### 4. How to Use `/authorize`

1. In any Discord channel where your bot is invited, type:

   ```
   /authorize
   ```
2. The bot will reply with a private link (only you can see it).
3. Click the link, copy the **authorization code** you see.
4. Back in Discord, type (replace `CODE123` with the one you got):

   ```
   /authorize code:CODE123
   ```
5. If successful, the bot will say ‚ÄúYou are now verified!‚Äù and you can start chatting or sending images.

   ![Authorize flow in Discord](images/authorize-flow.png)
   *(Insert a screenshot of the bot replying with the link, and then the user sending `/authorize code:...`.)*

---

### 5. Common Troubleshooting

* **Bot doesn‚Äôt start / crash on launch:**

  * Double-check that your `.env` (or Render environment variables) are correct‚Äîno extra spaces or missing quotes.
  * Ensure you ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
  * Check the Discord token: if it‚Äôs revoked, regenerate it in the Developer Portal.
* **Bot is online but doesn‚Äôt respond to commands:**

  * Make sure your bot is invited to the server with the correct permissions (e.g. ‚ÄúSend Messages,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead Message History,‚Äù ‚ÄúUse Slash Commands‚Äù).
  * Check that you registered the slash commands (sometimes you need to run a separate script or wait a few minutes for Discord to update).
* **‚ÄúInvalid authorization code‚Äù when using `/authorize`:**

  * Copy the code exactly (no extra spaces).
  * Make sure you clicked the link from the same Discord user‚Äîonly that user sees the code.

---

### 6. Adding Your Own Images

Whenever you want to show what something looks like (for example, how to set up a Discord application or how your terminal should look), add images into a folder called `images/` (or whatever you like). Then, in the README:

```markdown
![Description of what this screenshot shows](images/your-image-file.png)
```

* Keep image filenames short and descriptive (e.g., `clone-repo.png`, `discord-token.png`).
* Make sure to commit and push the `images/` folder alongside your README.

---

### 7. Congrats‚ÄîYou‚Äôre Done!

If you followed these steps, your **self-hosted** ShapesInc AI Chatbot for Discord should be up and running.

* Anyone in your server can now chat, send images, and get code suggestions.
* Each user must run `/authorize` once to verify.
* You can always come back to this README if you need reminders or want to add more screenshots.

Happy hosting!
