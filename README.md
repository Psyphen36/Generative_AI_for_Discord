## üìö Generative AI Chatbot for Discord ‚Äî User Manual

---

### 1. What This Bot Does

- **Image Understanding:** Send pictures, and the bot will describe or respond to them.
- **Natural Conversations:** Chat as if you‚Äôre talking to a real person.
- **On-Demand Code Generation:** Request code snippets tailored to your prompts.
- **User Recognition:** Maintains separate contexts for each Discord user, so it never confuses one user for another.
- **Secure Authorization:** Requires each user to verify via `/authorize` before chatting ensuring the bot knows who it‚Äôs talking to.
- **Others:** use $help to see more secret features!

---

### 2. Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account** (to clone the repository).  
- **ShapesInc Account** (to obtain your API key and App ID).  
- **Discord Account** (to create and manage your Discord bot).  
- **Internet-Connected Computer** (to run and test the bot).  
- **Optional Hosting Service** (if you need 24/7 uptime). We‚Äôll demonstrate using [Render](https://render.com/), which has a free tier and doesn‚Äôt require a credit card. You can substitute any service that integrates with GitHub.

* **Install Dependencies**

- Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
  
- In the cloned repo‚Äôs root folder, first:
 
   create a virtual environment:
  
 ```ruby

 ```
  
   Activate it:
  
  - On Linux/macOS:
  
```bash
source ChatBot_env/bin/activate
``` 
   
- On Windows (PowerShell):

```css
ChatBot_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

 **Configure Environment Variables**

- In the repo folder, rename `test.env` to `.env` (if it doesn‚Äôt exist create one).
   
- Open `.env` in your text editor and Replace each placeholder in quotes with your actual values.

```ini
SHAPES_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
SHAPES_APP_ID="your_app_id_here"
DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token_here"
MODEL="your_model_name_here"
OWNER_ID="Your discord id"
OWNER_ID="Your trusted one's discord id"
```
   
3. **Start the Bot**

```css
python3 main.py
```

- You should see log messages like ‚ÄúBot is starting‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnected to Discord.‚Äù

### 4. How to Use `/authorize`

* In any channel where your bot is present, type:

```ruby
/authorize
```

* The bot will reply with a private link (only visible to you).  
![Authorize Link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c7ee059-1c26-4a99-89d2-a91cf3bfad63)

* Click the link and copy the **authorization code** displayed.  
![Authorized Code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47e92ea5-a31c-42b4-b4a2-85bb995748b7)

4. Return to Discord and run:

```ruby
/authorize code:YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

- Replace `YOUR_CODE_HERE` with the code you copied.
   
* If successful, you‚Äôll see:

```text
Successfully Authorised!
```

![Successfully Authorised](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf4adc6-784d-4b3e-ab0b-4d1924ed4cce)

Now you can start your conversation with the bot

### 5. Common Troubleshooting

- **Bot Won‚Äôt Start or Crashes on Launch**

- Verify your `.env` (or Render environment variables) have no extra spaces and correct quotation marks.
   
- Ensure you ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

- Check your Discord token if it was regenerated or revoked, update it in your environment.
   
- **Bot Is Online but Doesn‚Äôt Respond**

- Confirm the bot has been invited with the right permissions (e.g., ‚ÄúSend Messages,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead Message History,‚Äù ‚ÄúUse Slash Commands‚Äù).
   
- Make sure slash commands are registered. Sometimes you need to restart the bot or wait a few minutes for Discord to sync.

- **‚ÄúInvalid Authorization Code‚Äù When Using `/authorize`**

- Copy the code exactly no extra spaces or line breaks.
   
- Ensure you clicked the link from the same Discord account that ran `/authorize`.
